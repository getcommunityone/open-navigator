# Ballotpedia Data Scripts

Scripts for scraping Ballotpedia ballot measures and loading them into bronze.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ballotpedia_integration.py` | Core scraper (`BallotpediaDiscovery`) — officials, ballot measures, external links |
| `download_ballotpedia_measures.py` | Bulk-scrape state + jurisdiction ballot-measure pages → JSON cache |
| `load_ballotpedia_measures_to_bronze.py` | Load cache JSON → `bronze.bronze_ballot_measures_ballotpedia` |

## Quick start

```bash
# Scrape (defaults: 6 priority states × 2025 + 2026)
python packages/scrapers/src/scrapers/ballotpedia/download_ballotpedia_measures.py

# Load bronze (defaults: election years 2025, 2026 only)
python packages/scrapers/src/scrapers/ballotpedia/load_ballotpedia_measures_to_bronze.py --truncate

# Apply DDL (Neon)
./packages/hosting/scripts/neon/psql_resolved.sh -f packages/hosting/scripts/neon/migrations/057_create_bronze_ballot_measures_ballotpedia.sql
```

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BALLOTPEDIA_PLAYWRIGHT_ONLY` | `1` | Use Playwright for every request (default). Set `0` to try httpx first |
| `BALLOTPEDIA_USE_PLAYWRIGHT` | `1` | When httpx-first (`PLAYWRIGHT_ONLY=0`), escalate to Playwright on 202/challenge |
| `BALLOTPEDIA_PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS_MODE` | `new` | `new`, `legacy`, or `headed` |
| `BALLOTPEDIA_INTER_REQUEST_DELAY` | `2.0` | Seconds between httpx requests |
| `BALLOTPEDIA_PLAYWRIGHT_CONTENT_RETRIES` | `3` | Reload attempts when article body is empty |

If headless scrapes keep failing, try headed mode:

```bash
BALLOTPEDIA_PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS_MODE=headed \
  python packages/scrapers/src/scrapers/ballotpedia/download_ballotpedia_measures.py --states AL
```

## Troubleshooting `challenge_blocked` / HTTP 202

Ballotpedia returns **HTTP 202** to httpx, so the scraper uses **Playwright by default**. If you still see `reason=challenge_blocked`:

1. **Install Chromium** (most common fix when `artifacts=[]`):
   ```bash
   ./.venv/bin/playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Rate limiting** — wait 10–15 minutes between bulk runs, or increase delay between states:
   ```bash
   BALLOTPEDIA_STATE_DELAY=30 \
     ./.venv/bin/python packages/scrapers/src/scrapers/ballotpedia/download_ballotpedia_measures.py
   ```

3. **WSL / headless blocks** — use headed mode with a display, or system Chrome:
   ```bash
   BALLOTPEDIA_PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome BALLOTPEDIA_PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS_MODE=headed \
     ./.venv/bin/python packages/scrapers/src/scrapers/ballotpedia/download_ballotpedia_measures.py --states AL
   ```

4. **Inspect failures** — check `data/cache/ballotpedia/playwright_debug/*.html` and the matching `fetch_debug/*.json` (the `error` field now includes the Playwright exception when present).
